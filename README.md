# LibC
LibC provides C implementations of data structures and typical algorithms for general use. Here are what we've done. 

## Data Structure
* Sequential Stack
* Cycular Queue
* AVL Tree and Binary Searching Tree based on it
* Concurrent RB Tree (based on linux kernel 2.6)
* Concurrent Map based on rb tree
* hashtable by double hashing with dynamic resize
* complete binary tree and min heap based on it
* an array min heap
* linked list, double linked list (based on linux kernel 2.6)
* concurrent linked hash map with dynamic resize and treeify to rbtree
* graph (adj list)
* LCRS tree


## Algorithm
* dijkstra algorithm
* critical path
* prim algorithm
* topological sort

* merge sort
* quick sort
* m-way merge sort

## application examples

### todo
* huffman tree
* hanoi
* hanoi(non recursive)
* polynomial calculation
* infix_to_postfix expression and infix calculaiton

* 4-way huffman tree
* simulated memory management
