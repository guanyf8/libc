# LibC
LibC provides C implementations of data structures and typical algorithms for general use. Here are what we've done. 

## Data Structure
* sequential stack
* cycular queue
* avl tree and binary searching tree based on it
* concurrent rb tree (based on linux kernel 2.6)
* concurrent map based on rb tree
* hashtable by double hashing with dynamic resize
* complete binary tree and min heap based on it
* an array min heap
* linked list, double linked list (based on linux kernel 2.6)
* concurrent linked hash map with dynamic resize and treeify to rbtree

### todo
* graph (adj list)
* LCRS tree
## Algorithm

### todo


* dijkstra algorithm
* critical path
* prim algorithm
* topological sort

* merge sort
* quick sort

## application examples

### todo
* huffman tree
* hanoi
* hanoi(non recursive)
* polynomial calculation
* infix_to_postfix expression and infix calculaiton
* m-way merge sort
* 4-way huffman tree
* simulated memory management
