# LibC
LibC provide C implementation of data structures and typical algorithms for general use. Here are what we've made. 

## Data Structure
* sequential stack
* cycular queue
* avl tree
* rb tree(picked up from linux kernel 2.6)
* map based on rb tree
* hashtable with double hashing

## Algorithm
